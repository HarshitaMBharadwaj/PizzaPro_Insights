## Data Analysis Using SQL

### 1. Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_revenue FROM pizza_sales;
```
### 2. Average order value
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price)/ COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Total_revenue FROM pizza_sales
```
### 3. Total Pizza Sold
```sql
SELECT SUM(qunamtity) AS Total_revenue FROM pizza_sales
```
### 4. Total order placed
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Total_orders FROM pizza_sales
```
### 5. Average Pizzas Per Order:
```sql
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2))/ CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS avg_perorder FROM pizza_sales
```
### 6. Hourly Trend for total pizzas sold
```sql
SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) as order_hour, SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
```
### 7. Weekly trends for total orders
```sql
SELECT DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, order_date) as week_number, YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) as total_orders FROM  pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, order_date), YEAR(order_date)
ORDER BY DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, order_date), YEAR(order_date)
```
### 8. Percentage of sales by pizza category
```sql
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price) AS Total_sales , SUM(total_price) *100/ (SELECT sum(total_price) From pizza_sales WHERE MONTH(order_date)=1) AS PCT_SALES FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date)=1
GROUP BY pizza_category
```
### 9. Percentage of sales by pizza size:
```sql
SELECT pizza_size, SUM(total_price) AS Total_sales , CAST(SUM(total_price) *100/ 
(SELECT sum(total_price) From pizza_sales )AS DECIMAL(10,2))AS PCT_SALES
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY PCT_SALES 
SELECT pizza_size, SUM(total_price) AS Total_sales , CAST(SUM(total_price) *100/ 
(SELECT sum(total_price) From pizza_sales WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date)=1)AS DECIMAL(10,2))AS PCT_SALES
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER, order_date)=1
GROUP BY pizza_size
```
### 10. Top 5 Best sellers by revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:
#### A) BY REVENUE
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_revenue FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY (Total_revenue) DESC
```
##### B) BY QUANTITY
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_quantity FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY (Total_quantity) DESC
```
#### C)TOTAL ORDERS
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) AS Total_order FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY (Total_order) DESC
```
### 11. Bottom 5 Best sellers by revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders:
#### A) BY REVENUE
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_revenue FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY (Total_revenue)
```
#### B) BY QUANTITY
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_quantity FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY (Total_quantity)
```
#### C)TOTAL ORDERS
